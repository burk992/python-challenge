# Code sourcing

I had to watch a few Youtube videos, as PyBank and PyPoll are classic learning assignments for those learning Python, and searched around on Stack Overflow in order to figure out how to write a text document out of my code after printing it. I also saw in some examples where PyBank required use of two resource csv files where setting paths early for input/output saved a few lines of code during the final bits of terminal printing and text file printing. Elsewise, everything else was written by me with the help of many of our "Solved" exercises from class. 

# Final notes

Everything in this assignment should be working properly with the exception of the final PyBank average monthly change number. It is printing a positive number when it should be negative and I ran out of time troubleshooting my code to figure out why. If I figure out why, I will likely just submit the assignment for a regrade.
